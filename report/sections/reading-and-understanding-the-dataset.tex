After defining the business goals and the goals of data mining in the Business Understanding phase, the next crucial step in the CRISP-DM process is Data Understanding.
This phase involves collecting the initial dataset, examining its structure, and verifying data quality.
The primary goal is to become familiar with the dataset, identify potential quality issues, and extract early insights.

In this image, we can see that out of all 5679 text values which included email headers, subjects and the likes, 5329 of them are unique values.
From this information, we can learn that the dataset has a large variety of values, and no duplicates are missing values that may impact the quality of the dataset significantly in any way.

Various NLP techniques were applied to explore the email content:
